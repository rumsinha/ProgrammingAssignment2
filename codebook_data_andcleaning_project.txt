Codebook for the tidy dataset

==============================================================================================
For Tidy.txt:

    Test and train data is merged for subject and activity
    Features are applied for column naming
    Activity labels are applied to the activity column
    Data set is aggregated by subject and by activity by calculating the mean
    File written as Tidy.txt
===============================================================================================
	
Subject and Activity

These variables identify the unique subject/activity pair the variables relate to:

    Subject: the integer subject ID.
    Activity: the string activity name:
        Walking
        Walking Upstairs
        Walking Downstairs
        Sitting
        Standing
        Laying
These are factor variables.

==================================================================================================
Measurement Means

All variables are the mean of a measurement for each subject and activity. This is indicated by the initial Mean in the variable name. All values are numeric type.

All the old variable names renamed as below:

column names having "Acc" replaced with "Accelerometer"
column names having "Gyro" replaced with "Gyroscope"
column names having "BodyBody" replaced with "Body"
column names having "Mag" replaced with "Magnitude"
column names having "^t" replaced with "Time"
column names having "^f" replaced with "Frequency"
column names having "tBody" replaced with "TimeBody"
column names having "-mean()" replaced with "Mean"
column names having "-std()" replaced with "STD"
column names having "-freq()" replaced with"Frequency"
column names having "angle" replaced with "Angle"
column names having "gravity" replaced with "Gravity"
